# memory-game
A memory game to match pairs of cards by color and icon. Built from initial html, css, and JavaScript provided by Springboard, 
this page was set up to allow users to alter the number of cards in the game and track their scores on each card total. This
page includes CSS transitions and JS timeouts to animate card flips in-game, and the code randomly assigns Unicode emojis to 
each card pair - making the game more friendly to users with colorblindness.
